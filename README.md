## ðŸ’» Project

The so famous whole list of life, I've done this type of project other times, but now I wanted to create it with **ReactJS**. Basically the user can add, edit and delete their tasks.


below is a demo of the project

## Details

- In the project the firebase authentication service is used.
- The user only needs to login once.
- User data is saved in the browser via localStorage. A good solution for this scenario, maybe in the future we will use a database.
- In the project I used a package called [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) . It's a tiny package that lets you work with the immutable state in a more convenient way.
